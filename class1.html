  <p>In humans the base of the cranium is the occipital bone, which has a central opening (foramen magnum) to admit the spinal cord. 
    The parietal and temporal bones form the sides and uppermost portion of the dome of the cranium, and the frontal bone forms the forehead; 
    the cranial floor consists of the sphenoid and ethmoid bones. The facial area includes the zygomatic, or malar, bones (cheekbones),
    which join with the temporal and maxillary bones to form the zygomatic arch below the eye socket; the palatine bone; and the maxillary,
    or upper jaw, bones. The nasal cavity is formed by the vomer and the nasal, lachrymal, and turbinate bones. In infants the sutures (joints) between the various skull elements are loose, but with age they fuse together. Many mammals, such as the dog, have a sagittal crest down the centre of the skull; this provides an extra attachment site for the temporal muscles, which close the jaws.
